        <!-- Purchasing Terms -->
        <div class="purchasing-terms">
            <h2>Purchasing Terms</h2>
            <p>Tickets will be available for purchase on the Website, during periods to be defined by the Organizer. The Organizer is entitled to curtail or to extend the periods during which the Tickets are available for purchase, at any point in time, by any means and/or on any medium and via any intermediaries whatsoever.</p>
            <p>The Organizer alone will take decisions regarding the distribution channels of the Tickets and will be entitled to offer different terms of sale for the Tickets, such as for sales of individual Tickets or of “passes/packages” of Tickets. The details herein will be available on the Website. Similarly, the Organizer is entitled to grant a direct or indirect right to purchase Tickets or priority rights to purchase tickets during a given period of time.</p>
            <p>The Organizer may impose quantity limitations on orders of certain Tickets or certain passes/packages of Tickets, be it for all purchases made by the same Buyer or for a given order. The Organizer may also implement a waiting list or registration group for ordering Tickets.</p>
            <p>Software applications that place orders for Tickets automatically via the Internet and/or that can replicate the online purchasing activity of several persons, such as “Bots” or other software applications that can be used to order and buy tickets, are prohibited. If it appears that any Tickets have been obtained in this way, these Tickets will be considered as invalid, and the Holder of such a Ticket will be denied access to the venues, without being entitled to any refund.</p>
            <p>Any Tickets that are obtained via a distribution channel other than those authorised by the Organizer will be null and void and may be cancelled without the Holder being entitled to any refund.</p>
            <p>The Buyer is hereby informed about the existence of various categories of special-rate seats, such as for people with a disability or for group purchases, which may be booked subject to availability and which are subject to special terms and conditions that will be available to any interested parties.</p>
            <p>The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Tickets that are allocated to them might be for seats that are not located side by side or even near one another. An optional paid supplement will be available on the Website to enable the Buyer to select the seats they wish to book using a seating plan.</p>
            <p>The Organizer may implement special terms of purchase, including a mechanism for including a ballot system, under the supervision of a bailiff, among all of the Buyers wishing to place orders for one or more Tickets to specific games. The terms applicable to any such mechanism for including a ballot system will be covered by rules that will be published on the Website.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Immediate, Deferred, Part or Group Payment, and Method of Payment</h2>

            <p>If a Buyer makes a deposit and is placed on a waiting list, the Buyer understands and agrees that the total payment for their order will only be taken when their entire order for Tickets becomes available and is confirmed.</p>
            <p>Any payment default (such as an authorisation failure based on the information requested from the Buyer by 3D Secure Credit Cards or e-Wallets) will automatically lead to the cancellation of the proposed order.</p>
            <p>Once the Buyer has paid for the order, they will receive an order confirmation by email.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Ticket Prices -->
        <div class="ticket-prices">
            <h2>Ticket Prices</h2>
            <p>The price of the Ticket will be provided in the local currencies. Some tickets may have additional tax and ticket booking fees or some tickets will have fees and taxes included pursuant to local laws. Any local taxes or ticket booking fees that may be applicable will be based on the prevailing rate on the date of the order.</p>
            <p>The Organizer is entitled to modify its policy and terms of sale at any time, without notice.</p>
            <p>The Tickets will be charged at the rates that are enforced at the time of the order.</p>
            <p>Any additional options proposed to the Buyer when they place their order may be conditional upon the payment of additional costs. In case of cancellation of the Ticket, whatever the reason for this, these costs will not be reimbursed.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Delivery of the Ticket -->
        <div class="ticket-delivery">
            <h2>Delivery of the Ticket</h2>
            <p>For environmental reasons, Tickets will be delivered primarily in the form of an electronic ticket (“e-Tickets”), although exceptions to this rule may be made. Mobile tickets (“m-Tickets”) may also be delivered.</p>
            <p>The Tickets will be made available in the Buyer’s ticketing account or sent by email. Purchase of tickets can be made before the tickets are available for receipt.

            <p>Some tickets may be delivered or purchased on the ground (at the venue’s box office).</p>
            <p>The Organizer is entitled to cancel, without notice and without any refund, any purchase of a Ticket that might involve a risk of fraud, such as in case of a fraudulent use of a payment card, or in case of a breach of the security of the event.</p>
        </div>

If need be, the Holder of an e-ticket or m-ticket may make contact with the customer service officers at the venues, to have their ticket printed on a physical medium.</p>
            <p>Any exit from the venues will be final. The Holder will not be permitted to re-enter the venues.</p>
